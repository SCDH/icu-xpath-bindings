## How to contribute to ICU XPath bindings

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub
  under [Issues](https://github.com/scdh/icu-xpath-bindings/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open
  a new
  one](https://github.com/scdh/icu-xpath-bindings/issues/new). Be sure
  to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant
  information as possible. Include a **code sample** that shows how
  you used the XPath extension. Also include the error message you
  get.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and
  solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything
substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will
generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the developers mentioned in the
  [`pom.xml`](pom.xml) file via e-mail and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have positive feedback
  about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug
  reports and fixes.

#### Release policy

Release numbers follow the `MAJOR.MINOR.BUGFIX` scheme. Releases are
automated by github actions and are triggered by pushing a tag with a
name matching the scheme.
